# NFL Sports React Native App

## Development

See guides here for React Native installation: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started

Enter the command `expo start` to launch a dev server and QR code for local development.

## Code

Components are located in the `components/` directory and screens are located in the `screens/` directory. The app begins at `App.js`.

## Notes

Some data is "N/A" in the API, such as the manager of the Bengals. I implemented this with an "N/A" placeholder.
